	abstract = {Currently there is a declining participation of women in Information Technology (IT) education and profession. In this article a critical interpretive analysis of the international discourse about women in IT is performed. The aim is to understand why women experience such a low level of career satisfaction in IT by taking their experiences and the context of the IT industry into consideration. The authors will critically analyse the results from the interpretive analysis and challenge the reasons identified as the cause for the under-representation of women in the IT industry. This study can be used to gain more insight into and understanding (reflection) of the current situation, but it can also contribute to communities such as feminists or governments in the creation of an emancipation theory or a series of interventions to improve the situation for women in IT.},

	abstract = {There is a shortage of women in computer science. An approach is needed to increase women and girls' interest in computer programming. To identify the best framework for both K-12 and higher education institutions to use to influence girls' view of Computer Science (CS), a thematic analysis of over 30 research papers and resources from the National Center for Women and Information Technology (NCWIT) website was conducted. Summarizing the different successful approaches taken by various researchers in increasing the number of girls and women studying CS and categorizing the approaches based on similar themes revealed that there are four common methods used to encourage girls to pursue CS. The Four Es model- Expose, Engage, Encourage and Empower-is derived from this analysis. The model can be used by institutions as a framework to increase women and girls' interest in studying and pursuing computer science careers.},

In this paper, we investigate the issues and barriers that prevent women from entering the games industry, as well as the solutions and steps that can be taken to attract more women to the industry. We draw on the lessons learned by the information technology industry and report on a program of events that was conducted at the Queensland University of Technology in 2011. These events provided some insight into the issues surrounding the lack of women in the games industry, as well as some initial steps that we can take as an industry to attract and support more female developers.},

	abstract = {Women, as well as African Americans, Hispanic Americans and Native Americans are represented in the information technology (IT) workforce in percentages that are far lower than their percentages in the population as a whole. While recruiting efforts are crucial for increasing the participation of women and minorities, it is equally important that we retain those already in the IT workforce. Here we present an assessment of the relevant literature addressing retention issues for women and minorities. Some issues that arise from this literature can be applied directly to changes that must take place in the IT workplace such as; the development of gender/race/ethnic appropriate mentors, sponsors or role models in the work environment, the development of involvement of the family and/or community in support of the work environment, the development of a nurturing work environment to offset internalized out-group status, the development of a truly multicultural work environment that values gender/race/ethnic differences, the development of recognition of and assistance with stress from financial issues and social/family obligations, and the eradication of institutional practices that marginalize women and minorities. There is a need to deepen our understanding of retention issues for women and minorities in order to inform intervention strategies. This work addresses this need by providing an in-depth examination of factors affecting attraction, development and especially retention of minorities and women in IS.},

	abstract = {This paper begins a comprehensive analysis of gender and virtual gaming, and the ethics and legality surrounding this dyad. The first part of the paper introduces the ideas of gaming as an act of representational politics - what is taking place with female images, girls and women as characters and as players, and consequently, how can we assess the ethical significance of these in a broad social realm? While various sociologists, psychologists, educators and others debate the direct and causal impact of video and computer gaming on children and young adults in terms of violence, this paper avoids that hotly contested link (especially within the current climate of school shootings and children-on-children violence). Instead, the legalistic concept of "dangerous information" is invoked and explored. We argue that such forms of expression as music, games, film, television, etc., do not in and of themselves incite or promote violence, bias, bigotry or sexism. A large amount of case law is presented and discussed to support this premise. Instead, these forms of "entertainment" contribute to forms of social discourse and maintain a rigid politics of gender in which women and girls are relegated to the unethical social realm where they exist only as victims or vixens, or do not exist at all.},

Despite the widespread availability of jobs, the challenging and exciting nature of the work, and the impressive earning potential of workers, the (industry is experiencing a massive decline in the number of new recruits. Universities and companies alike are starting to wonder: where did all the warm bodies go? Numbers from the US are showing declines upwards of 20\%, and across North America it is not uncommon to find decreases in students applying to computer science post-secondary programmes that double that. It appears that a dearth of highly-trained professionals is looming, which is bound to negatively impact future advances in computer technology and ultimately threaten major economies. Given the current crisis, many groups are addressing the issue, with varying approaches and perspectives. The film "The Elephant in the Room: Who Will Take Care of the Code?", exposes the symptoms of this problem and examines some of the current solutions. In particular, this film profiles efforts at the University of Victoria in the CScIDE Computer Science Initiatives for Diversity and Equity research group and their experiements introducing programming concepts to children in grades two through seven.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the way that professional women working in the IT industry discuss the nature of their work. The research is part of an ongoing project (WinIT) commenced in 1995, which seeks to understand the declining female participation in IT education and work. An examination of our interview data using concepts from Giddens' structuration theory shows that a number of dualisms provide the women with interpretive schemes through which they can interpret and make sense of their working lives. Such dualisms may provide ontological security as representations of the routines which women in the IT industry enact in their daily activities. This paper suggests that the way women talk about their work reinforces widely held impressions of the IT industry. The use of structuration theory helps show how this talk is not always consistent with the womens' lived experiences. The interviews reveal contradictions in these dualisms, indicating that these polarised views of women and IT work are being undermined by women in the IT industry. In order to understand better how women help configure the institutional realm of IT work, we propose that more qualitative studies of women at work in IT as well as women talking about IT are needed.},
