	abstract = {Previous research on individual demographic characteristics has typically examined only direct effects on outcomes such as work attitudes and behavior. This investigation examined the multivariate effects of six demographic variables--age, gender, race, education, and company and job tenure--on superiors' ratings of performance and liking for subordinates and subordinates' role ambiguity and conflict. A field study of 272 superior-subordinate dyads produced results that support the notion that increasing dissimilarity in superior-subordinate demographic characteristics, referred to here as "relational demography," is associated with lower effectiveness as perceived by superiors, less personal attraction on the part of superiors for subordinates, and increased role ambiguity experienced by subordinates. These effects were found even after we controlled for the effects of simple demographic variables.},

	abstract = {We used self-categorization theory--which proposes that people may use social characteristics such as age, race, or organizational membership to define psychological groups and to promote a positive self-identity--to develop and test hypotheses about the effects of demographic diversity in organizations on an individual's psychological and behavioral attachment to the organization. Individual-level commitment, attendance behavior, and tenure intentions were examined as a function of the individual's degree of difference from others on such social categories as age, tenure, education, sex, and race. We expected that the effect of being different would have different effects for minorities (i.e., women and nonwhites) than for members of the majority (i.e., men and whites). Analyses of a sample of 151 groups comprising 1,705 respondents showed that increasing work-unit diversity was associated with lower levels of psychological attachment among group members. Nonsymmetrical effects were found for sex and race, with whites and men showing larger negative effects for increased unit heterogeneity than nonwhites and women. The results of the study call into question the fundamental assumption that underlies much of race and gender research in organizations--that the effect of heterogeneity is always felt by the minority.},

	abstract = "Although generally accepted in the literature on group diversity, the view that groups can improve their creativity by drawing on the diverse perspectives of group members has received surprisingly limited examination or empirical support. This paper considers the role of deep level diversity in group creativity, highlighting that while deep diversity may improve divergent processes in groups, it may also hamper groups' ability to converge around creative ideas. Two experimental studies demonstrate that deep level diversity leads to less creatively elaborated and integrated ideas. In addition, the studies revealed that when groups must converge around a single output, the challenges of deep level diversity outweigh the benefits of divergent idea generation. A detailed analysis of the interactions of 27 groups finds that this effect occurs because deep diversity changes a group's creative process. This study contributes to our understanding of the creative process in groups with detailed analysis of video-taped group interactions. It challenges the assumed advantages of deep level diversity to group creativity, and suggests that the brainstorming process that groups are typically advised to use to promote creativity may not be the best way to develop creative final output."

This model involves team intrinsic motivation as a mediator and transformational leadership as a moderator. The Hierarchical Linear Modeling results using 62 teams revealed that transformational leadership moderated cognitive diversity's direct effect on team intrinsic motivation and indirect effect on team creativity via team intrinsic motivation, such that the effects were positive when transformational leadership was high, but negative when transformational leadership was low."

	abstract = { In four methodologically diverse studies (N = 644), we found correlational (Study 1), longitudinal (Study 2), and experimental (Studies 3 and 4) evidence that a sense of belonging predicts how meaningful life is perceived to be. In Study 1 (n = 126), we found a strong positive correlation between sense of belonging and meaningfulness. In Study 2 (n = 248), we found that initial levels of sense of belonging predicted perceived meaningfulness of life, obtained 3 weeks later. Furthermore, initial sense of belonging predicted independent evaluations of participants essays on meaning in life. In Studies 3 (n = 105) and 4 (n = 165), we primed participants with belongingness, social support, or social value and found that those primed with belongingness (Study 3) or who increased in belongingness (Study 4) reported the highest levels of perceived meaning. In Study 4, belonging mediated the relationship between experimental condition and meaning. }

	abstract = { GamerGate is a viral campaign that became an occasion, particularly from August 2014 to January 2015, to both question journalistic ethics and badger women involved in game development and gaming criticism. Gaming journalists thus found themselves managing a debate on two fronts: defending the probity of gaming journalism and remediating attacks on women. This study explores how gaming journalists undertook paradigm maintenance in the midst of the controversy. This was analyzed through interviews with gaming journalists as well as a discourse analysis of the texts responding to GamerGate that were produced by their publications. Although gaming journalists operate within a form of lifestyle journalism, the journalists repaired their paradigm by linking their work to traditional journalism and emphasizing a paternal role. }
