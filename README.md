Essay, Unprofessional Edition  

Women are in the games industry but really not that much. A bunch of the sources I read said that it's going down. However, a UK source suggested that women are increasing in IT sectors at least between 2013 and 2018. [cite the thing]

But it is arguable that games are not particularly embedded in the IT sector. Many people [cite] say will argue that games are in fact an art. Yet in a broad sense, the art industry has a significantly higher proportion of women [cite]. Similarly, other media-related professions such as TV and film also have higher proportions of women.  

A distinction must be made between the development of technology and the usage of it. For example, this art is largely produced with technology. This includes Digital Art (concept art), 3D models, and level design blockouts in engines such as Unreal. However, the development of technology is primarily centred around programming. Are IT sectors focused on developing technologies rather than using them? I don't know. Wait, are we looking for answers here? We got nothing here guys.  

Various sociological factors could play a part in reduced participation. Atop debates around toxicity against women in the games workplaces [cite something], and in a frustratingly cyclical pattern, the issue of lower proportions of women joining the games industry could be partly caused by the higher proportion of men in the industry. This may centre of the sense of belonging [cite] wherein a member of a minority may be demotivated by the lack of role models, feeling marginalised. Furthermore, the status quo perpetuates stereotypes A kneejerk reaction would be to increase the proportion of skilled women in the workplace.  

At the core of the ethical issues is in achieving the shift in demographics. 

Stats from HESAderp repor. We could explore the difference between the proportion of female undergraduates compared to the proportion of men in the industry. The former could be considered a measure of interest in the industry while the latter could be considered the vital prevalence. Maybe- not entirely. After all, the industry is well-formed: people young and old work in the industry and the demographics will not change as rapidly as university demographics, which can respond much faster to the social conditioning of children and then students.  

However, the proportion of women studying computer science may also have dropped. This needs [citing] as we don't know! If this is the case, the issue reaches further than just the industry, infecting education as well.  

17% of women studied computer science in 2016/2017. This contrast is emphasised considering 56% of university students overall are female. A study in 2018 suggested that while men are 'more likely to be interested in the technology itself', women are 'more likely to be interested in its uses' [cite].  

Furthermore, a lack of significant female role models in programming would herpaderp derp boost flippin' cheeseburgers.

# Proposal: What affects the low participation of women in the game industry and how could this change?
Since the booming of social media sites such as Twitter, the respresentation of women in the gaming community has become a hot topic. Games outside the casual mobile gaming sphere highlight two notable trends: one, it is largely dominated by male players; and two, that is changing rapidly. However, behind the discussions of misogyny, abuse and oppression in gaming culture hides a crucial question: why are men still the majority of people making them?  

My essay will explore this topic and attempt to propose strategies to facilitate the participation of women in the industry, in the likely case that it is not primarily due to a lack of interest. The essay will make the key suggestion that the cultures of developer and player are closely linked. In other words, should developers change, the audience should change with it, and vice versa.  

Unfortunately, due to its traditionally binary and subjective nature, it is difficult to reach firm agreeable conclusions on the topic without the influence of gender bias of the author themself. The essay will instead focus on deriving subjective theories based on comparison and analysis of data trends and broad psychological research.  

## Culture
An insight into the #GamerGate controversy is telling. During this incident in 2015(?), several women were harrassed by large mobs of anonymous Internet trolls for their stances on representational ethics in gaming.  

One could assume that the increased conversation around this topic would improve awareness and begin remedying the issue through encouragement of rational discussion. (However: look into conversation, awareness, and avoidance of conflict. Consider potentially divisive effects. Consider how this seeming commonness of internet trolling and harassment could affect women now that they are further aware).  

How does the culture differ between gaming and women in STEM? Are they equivalent or different?

## Key Questions include:  
* Desire: Is there an autonomous desire to work in the game industry by women? Does a desire to have more women match the desires of women to develop games?  
* Cultural impact: How does male-dominated work culture impact women, and why?  
* Play vs Make: What is the associon between gaming toxicity and development workplace toxicity?  
* How to change it: Assuming the desire is indeed there, how could the balance be improved and toxicity eliminated?  

## Further areas of interest include:
* General balance: Is it true that if social norms were eliminated, biologically male and female people would enjoy the same professions in a balanced fashion?  
* Language barriers: Is misogyny and misandry influenced by communication barriers?  
* Misogyny: How does evidential misogyny compare in and outside the game development workplace?  
* Misdandry: Does misandry exist in female-dominated workplaces?  
* Student/worker balance: is there a disparity between the gender ratio of game students versus game professionals? If so, what are the causes?

Broad article about women in the industry, 2013. Highlights:  
* Proportion of women in the UK industry **fell** between 2009 and 2006, 12% to 4%.  
* The percentage shrinks further as the majority do not actually do production work.  
* Women's salaries are notably lower for the same job. (note: do women know this, and how may that affect a studying woman's prospects, if she does not know?)

Falmouth link: https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ezproxy.falmouth.ac.uk/document/787302/  
An article about women as a video game audience, 1999. Interesting as a historical reference, particularly with respect to how social and ethical values have changed in the generations since. Highlights:  
* *"The now-defunct Purple Moon's Brenda Laurel flat out acknowledges that girls' interests are simply, fundamentally different from boys; girls seek relationships and exploration as opposed to repetitive, so-called skill-building tasks found in games for boys. And, withm these differences lies a deep cultural significance: Alloway and Gilbert assert "[Jlust as the Barbie doll culture constructs a highly gendered representational field targeted at girls, which includes multimedia cultural texts, images and objects, the world of video games offers much the same to boys and young men"*  
* *Must girls and young women be indoctrinated into a world of such few choices--can virtual females be protagonists if they don't look a certain way? Do "real" girls and women have virtual characters with whom to identify? They don't identify with Lara Croft, and the producers of Tomb Raider really do not care: "Eidos has sold 3 million copies to retailers, aiming at America's hormonal midsection: men 18 to 35 years old''*  
* *The fact that Barbie Fashion Designer was the top selling game for girls raises sigruficant issues surrounding claims of progress made on a feminist front.*
