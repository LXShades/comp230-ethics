# Proposal: Women and minorities in the game industry: How, why and where
Since the booming of social media sites such as Twitter, respresentation of women in videogames has become a hot topic. Games outside the casual mobile gaming sphere currently highlight two notable trends: one, it is largely dominated by male players; and two, that is changing rapidly. However, behind the discussions of misogyny, abuse and oppression in gaming culture hides a crucial question: why are men still the majority of people making them?  

My essay will explore this topic and attempt to propose strategies to facilitate the participation of women in the industry - if that is a goal. Unfortunately, due to its traditionally binary and subjective nature, it is difficult to reach firm agreeable conclusions on the topic without the influence of gender bias of the author themself. The essay will therefore focus on deriving subjective theories based on comparison and analysis of data trends and broad psychological research.  

## Key Questions include:  
* Desire: Is there an autonomous desire to work in the game industry by women? Does a desire to have more women match the desires of women to develop games?  
* Cultural impact: How does male-dominated work culture impact women, and why?  
* Play vs Make: What is the associon between gaming toxicity and development workplace toxicity?  
* How to change it: Assuming the desire is indeed there, how could the balance be improved and toxicity eliminated?  

## Further areas of interest include:
* General balance: Is it true that if social norms were eliminated, biologically male and female people would enjoy the same professions in a balanced fashion?  
* Language barriers: Is misogyny and misandry influenced by communication barriers?  
* Misogyny: How does evidential misogyny compare in and outside the game development workplace?  
* Misdandry: Does misandry exist in female-dominated workplaces?  
* Student/worker balance: is there a disparity between the gender ratio of game students versus game professionals? If so, what are the causes?

Broad article about women in the industry, 2013. Highlights:  
* Proportion of women in the UK industry **fell** between 2009 and 2006, 12% to 4%.  
* The percentage shrinks further as the majority do not actually do production work.
* Women's salaries are notably lower for the same job. (note: do women know this, and how may that affect a studying woman's prospects, if she does not know?)
