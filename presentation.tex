\section{Background}
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Background}
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item According to IGDA, women comprised 21\% of the game industry workforce in 2018 \cite{igda_satisfaction_2017} - down 1\% from 22\% in 2014 \cite{igda_satisfaction_2014}.
	    \item Similarly, in 2018, women comprised only 17\% of IT sectors in the UK \cite{uk_employees_2018} % (https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/datasets/employmentbyoccupationemp04)
	    \begin{itemize}
	        \item Management positions have the most balance: in 2018, the proportion of women in IT project and programme management positions was 32\% \cite{uk_employees_2018} (up from 15\% in 2013 \cite{uk_employees_2013}.)
	    \end{itemize}
	    \item Finally, according to HESA, only 17\% of computer science university students were female in 2016 \cite{hesa_2016} - corresponding with the IT industry
	    \begin{itemize}
	        \item This limitation in developing talent suggests the issue begins at a much earlier stage than the workplace.
	    \end{itemize}

\section{Issues}
\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Issues}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Having a ``sense of belonging'' is said to enhance meaning in life \cite{lambert_belonging_2013} (cite more...).
        \item Regular incidents of targeted harassment of women by vocal portions of the gaming community (see GamerGate) \cite{riot_lawsuit, gonzalez_boysclub_2014} (Cite more) could threaten this sense of belonging.
        \item In such an example of harassment and the resulting controversy, a minority may be inclined to believe that this is a result of being outnumbered by an oppressive entity.

    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Issues - Part 2}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Many studies (cite) and news articles (also cite) push for greater character diversity in games.
		\item Is the appeal of a game associated to the appeal to produce the games?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A rise in female gamers (cite) and drop in female developers (cite) challenge this hypothetical association.
		\end{itemize}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Games that represent women more could improve the sense of belonging in the gaming community through role model - predicting the desire to make games. (cite 'playing games' linked to making games)
			Are female players more likely to play games with female chracters (Cite study)
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Effects of improved diversity}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Not a problem-free circumstance
		\item Could vitally improve diversity of games due to increased creativity in diverse workplaces (CITE)
		\item A difference in gender, among other demographic differences, have been associated with a negative perception of subordinates by superiors overall  \cite{https://www.jstor.org/stable/256368?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents}
		\item An influential study analysing relational demography  \cite{http://www.paconference.ir/uploadfiles/2015-9-28/Being\%20Different\%20Relational\%20Demography\%20and\%20Organizational\%20Attachment.pdf} showed that workers in a heterogeneous workplace reported highest satisfaction when the organisation comprised members of their sex, as well as a general preference of homogeneity.

\frametitle{Impacts of discussion}
\framesubtitle{``even though our society has become sensitized to negative sex stereotypes [...], it remains blind to its gratuitous emphasis on the gender dichotomy itself.'' - S. L. Bem \cite{gender_schema}}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Discussion of discrimination is far from sufficient, but is necessary to facilitate the development of solutions.
	\item Movements such as \#MeToo and \#GamerGate raise awareness of the harassment of women in the workplace.
	\item Counter-productive effects:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Greater awareness of workplace harassment, while essential for progression, may simply portray the workplace as an unappealing and unreachable place for women
		\item Conflict avoidance (cite) between both sexes - perhaps especially women (cite) - reduces the appeal and increases a fear in identifying with aggressive feminist culture.
		\item Sensitivity to the topic from conflict-fearing individuals, for fear of tension, could hinder progress

    \frametitle{Outstanding Questions}
    \begin{itemize}
	    \item What are the links between game content and developer demographics?
	    \begin{itemize}
	        \item Hard to answer definitively: Demographics for players of specific games are hard to find.
	        \item Anecdotal intuition may suggest a natural link between the gender of an artist and its fanbase, owing to differences in preference and perspective.
	    \end{itemize}
	    \item What is the association between the IT industry and gaming industry?
	    \begin{itemize}
	        \item A 2009 study \cite{betsy_questioning_2009} found that the link between gaming and working in the IT industry was quite significant, even though the gender disparity between both industries is similar.
